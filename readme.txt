READABLE-MLATU - An C implementation of Mlatu
=============================================

Some Quiche Eaters have been complaining that code here is illegible, so I have named it readable-mlatu to assert their fallaciousness.


Compiling and running
---------------------
Run  make  to compile the repl.
Works with gcc/clang, hasn't been tested with any other compilers.
Running  make lib  will compile the mlatu.o file.
Once you have the repl,  rewrite.sh file.mlt  will rewrite each line of the file and print it.
There is only one command-line flag:  -s  , silent mode, which will suppress unnecessary printing.

Docs
----
Documentation can be found in the header file mlatu.h.
repl.c, and the examples folder, have examples of using mlatu.o.
