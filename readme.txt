READABLE-MLATU - An implementation of Mlatu written in C
========================================================

Some Quiche Eaters have been complaining that code here is illegible, so I have named it readable-mlatu to assert their fallaciousness.  
readable-mlatu is, under specific conditions, slightly faster than ENIAC!


Compiling and running
---------------------
Run `make repl` to make the repl.  
Works with gcc/clang, hasn't been tested with any other compilers.  
Mlatu rule files to be loaded in the repl can be passed as command line args, or loaded in the repl with `#wield`.
Running `make lib` will compile the `mlatu.o` file.  

Docs
----
Documentation can be found in the header file mlatu.h.
You can also look at repl.c for an example, and in the examples folder.
