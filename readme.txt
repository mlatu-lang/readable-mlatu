READABLE-MLATU - An C implementation of Mlatu
=============================================

Some Quiche Eaters have been complaining that code here is illegible, so I have named it readable-mlatu to assert their fallaciousness.  


Compiling and running
---------------------
Run  make repl  to make the repl.
Works with gcc/clang, hasn't been tested with any other compilers.  
Running  make lib  will compile the mlatu.o file.

Docs
----
Documentation can be found in the header file mlatu.h.
repl.c, and the examples folder, have examples of using mlatu.o.
